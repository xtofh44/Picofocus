Version 1.1

First development of this little code in micropython:

The purpose is to drive a stepper motor with a raspberry pico w with stepper motor driver A4899 to control the focuser of a telescope or whatever you want that need to move in and out.

there are 2 different speeds slow/fast (lent/rapide  yes I'm french :-) ) 

2 mmomentary push button for IN and OUT
1 maintained push button for Slow/fast

An oled lcd display is added to get information

The microstep mode is used for slow speed
